## Comment Length Analysis

### Comment Length
- Frequent buyers write significantly longer comments
- Non-frequent buyers tend to leave brief feedback

### Median Comparison
- Frequent: 120 words

  → Frequent buyers provide 4 times more detailed feedback on average

### Range of Detail
- Frequent: 100-word range (75 to 175)
- Non-frequent: 75-word range (25 to 100)
  → More consistent comment length from frequent buyers

### Minimum Effort
- Frequent buyers' shortest comments (75 words) are still longer than the median for non-frequent buyers (30 words)

### Maximum Engagement
- Some non-frequent buyers can be highly engaged (max 100 words)
